- **Pure Pipes for Heavy Computation**: The use of pure pipes is recommended for moving heavy computation away from the main thread. This approach helps in optimizing Angular apps by offloading computation to a separate layer, improving overall performance.
- **Performance Budgets and Auditing**: Developers are advised to use performance budgets for auditing, emphasizing the importance of setting benchmarks to ensure that an Angular app meets predefined performance criteria, preventing degradation over time.
- **Bundle Analysis with webpack-bundle-analyzer**: The chapter introduces webpack-bundle-analyzer as a tool for analyzing bundles, enabling developers to identify and address issues related to bundle size and dependencies, thereby optimizing the application's performance.



### Chapter 13, Building PWAs with Angular
**Progressive Web Apps** (**PWAs**) represent the cutting edge of web technology, seamlessly blending the strengths of web and mobile applications. Angular, with its built-in PWA support, emerges as an ideal platform for constructing robust and high-performance web applications. This chapter delves into the intricacies of PWAs, offering a comprehensive guide through the lens of Angular. The recipes cover essential aspects such as converting an existing Angular app into a PWA using the Angular CLI, modifying the theme color, implementing dark mode, customizing the installable experience, and leveraging Angular's service worker for efficient request precaching. By exploring these recipes, developers can transform their Angular applications into progressive web apps, ensuring installability, capabilities, speed, and reliability, even in challenging network conditions.

Angular's innate PWA features empower developers to enhance user experiences by providing seamless offline functionality and optimal performance. The chapter underscores the significance of PWAs as a significant leap in web technology, offering users a cohesive experience across various browsers and devices. The recipes serve as a practical guide for developers to implement key PWA features within their Angular applications, aligning with the broader industry shift towards resilient and user-centric web development practices. Through the exploration of themes, dark mode, custom installations, and service worker strategies, developers can harness the full potential of Angular for building progressive web apps that excel in both modern and legacy browser environments.
